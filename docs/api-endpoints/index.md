# Subject Interface REST API

The Subject Interface REST API provides operational endpoints for managing streaming sessions, subjects (TLCs), and authorization. Resources are automatically scoped to your domain and account context.

!!! note "TLC Terminology"
    The interface originally served Traffic Light Controllers (TLCs), and this legacy terminology persists in the API specifications for backward compatibility. "TLC" now refers to any connected entity: traffic controllers, sensors, barriers, displays, or any C-ITS participant. See [Terminology Reference](../appendix/evolution-terminology.md) for the mapping between legacy and generic terminology.
